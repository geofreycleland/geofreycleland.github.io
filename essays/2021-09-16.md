At the beginning, I stuggled to find a good screen recorder. At first, I tried to use VideoLAN but my audio wasn't recording so I had to try something else.
I then found out my PC has a screen recorder that is usually used for gaming and tried that. Once I figured out how to use it and started BrowserHistory1, I was able to do it first try.
I put 2 attempts on my WOD table because of the screen recorder issue. For BrowserHistory2, I also did 2 attempts because I struggled with the fonts. Other than that, I was able to do 
everything else. For BrowserHistory3, I tried to do it but was unsuccessful from the start. I had to watch the demonstration after and wrote alot of notes. After, I was able to figure it 
out and complete it. I also has problems with my server not keeping up with what I was doing in VS code. I learned recently to use CMD+ALT+R to hard refresh the page and now makes things
alot easier!
