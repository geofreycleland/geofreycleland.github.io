For the WOD invoice1 I had to make a table using 5 products and be able to use javascript to to replace the hardcode inside the table.

My experince from performing this WOD is that I have to be very specific with my code. Using javascript seemed to work better for me than the innerHTML. I feel like I am able to 
understand it easier. If i didn't, nothing would show on my table. There was an incident where I forgot a "t" in "quantity" and the whole table vanished.

To prepare, I watched all the screencasts and also the powerpoints included. If I needed additional help, I used https://www.w3schools.com/.

To prepare better, I think I need to practice more before hand. Also maybe write down some notes from the powerpoint that I think will be useful before performing the WOD.
